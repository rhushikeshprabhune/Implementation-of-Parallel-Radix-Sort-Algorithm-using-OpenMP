# Implementation-of-Parallel-Radix-Sort-Algorithm-using-OpenMP
Parallelized the Radix Sort algorithm using OpenMP constructs. Used synchronization techniques and analyzed the critical sections of the algorithm and optimized them to reduce parallelization overhead. Studied sorting time by varying the number of threads for different datasets.
